Final Project yuh

# Running Backend
To run the backend, first package with *mvn package* then run *java -cp target/backend-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.brown.app.App*
If you want to make it easier on yourself, you can copy and paste this in to your ~/.zshrc (or your ~/.shortcuts.sh if I've had at your computer):
alias run32="java -cp target/backend-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.brown.app.App"
Then, you can just use the command run32 to run the project
